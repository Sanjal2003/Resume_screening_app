AI-Based Resume Screening System

Built a machine learning-based application to automatically classify resumes into job categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Preprocessed resume text using NLTK and Spacy (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization) and converted text to numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization.

Trained a Decision Tree Classifier, achieving 99% accuracy on the test dataset.

Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to ensure model reliability.

Developed a real-time Streamlit web app allowing users to upload resumes and receive instant job category predictions.
